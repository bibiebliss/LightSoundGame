1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. None

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I think the only time i encountered challenges was with the javascript aspect. I dont know a lot about javascript so I got confused during some of the functions.
My buttons weren't sounding and I couldnt figure out why. So I calmed down and looked through my js code from the beginning again and it seemed fine. Then I remembered
that all three files are connected (the html, css, js) so I thought hmm maybe the problem isnt with my js file but with a connection so I looked through my other files
and figured out I hadnt correctly connected the button in the html file to the sound function. I also ran into some issues when trying to do the optional feature that entailed
making a new function in the js file to randomly generate the pattern because I wasnt sure how global/local variables worked in JS. But i researched it and did a little reading 
and then I was able to write the function.

Also during the optional of giving the user 3 tries... I could only get mine to work if the user got only the last sound in the pattern wrong and simply clicked the right one instead 
of being able to start over again.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
This was really fun. I'm mostly curious about how you make your code go live? I dont really know the term for it but how do you publicly host your website/game on the internet.
That is a skill I would be interested in learning.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I didnt do all the optionals so I would have loved to finish them all but I also did as much as I could. Apart from that maybe making the website a little more user friendly with different
navigations for other information or a feedback form :)
